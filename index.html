                        Essential oils are concentrated plant extracts that capture the natural scent and beneficial properties of plants. They work through aromatherapy (inhalation) or topical application, interacting with your body's systems to promote wellness. Each oil contains unique compounds that can support physical and emotional health.

                        Pure essential oils are 100% natural plant extracts without additives or synthetic compounds. Synthetic oils are laboratory-created fragrances that may smell similar but lack therapeutic benefits. Pure oils are tested for purity and potency, ensuring you get the full wellness benefits. Our app helps you identify quality indicators for each oil.

                        Store essential oils in dark glass bottles (amber or cobalt blue) away from direct sunlight and heat. Keep them in a cool, dry place with tightly closed caps.

                        Carrier oils are neutral plant oils (like coconut, jojoba, or almond oil) used to dilute essential oils before topical application. They "carry" the essential oil onto your skin safely, preventing irritation or sensitivity reactions. A typical dilution is 2-3 drops of essential oil per teaspoon of carrier oil for adults.

                        Yes, but with extra caution. Children's skin is more sensitive, so always use higher dilution ratios (1 drop per tablespoon of carrier oil for ages 2+). Some oils like eucalyptus and peppermint should be avoided for young children. Our app provides age-specific safety guidelines for each essential oil.

                        It depends on the use: For diffusing, use 3-5 drops per 100ml of water. For topical application, use a 1-3% dilution (3-6 drops per teaspoon of carrier oil for adults). For baths, use 5-10 drops mixed with a dispersant like Epsom salts. Our app provides specific recommendations for each application method.
