                    "question": "What are essential oils and how do they work?",
                    "answer": "Essential oils are concentrated plant extracts that capture the natural scent and beneficial properties of plants. They work through aromatherapy (inhalation) or topical application, interacting with your body's systems to promote wellness. Each oil contains unique compounds that can support physical and emotional health."
                },
                "q2": {
                    "question": "Are essential oils safe to use internally?",
                    "answer": "Internal use of essential oils should only be done under the guidance of a qualified healthcare professional or certified aromatherapist. While some oils are generally recognized as safe for internal use in small amounts, others can be toxic. Our app provides safety information for each oil, but always consult a professional before internal use."
                },
                "q3": {
                    "question": "How do I choose the right essential oil for my needs?",
                    "answer": "Our app makes it easy! Search from 400+ health conditions to find recommended oils, or browse our database of 140+ essential oils by their benefits. Each oil profile includes therapeutic properties, safety considerations, and recommended uses. Start with popular oils like lavender for relaxation or peppermint for energy."
                },
                "q4": {
                    "question": "What is the difference between pure and synthetic oils?",
                    "answer": "Pure essential oils are 100% natural plant extracts without additives or synthetic compounds. Synthetic oils are laboratory-created fragrances that may smell similar but lack therapeutic benefits. Pure oils are tested for purity and potency, ensuring you get the full wellness benefits. Our app helps you identify quality indicators for each oil."
                },
                "q5": {
                    "question": "Can I use essential oils during pregnancy?",
                    "answer": "Some essential oils should be avoided during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester. Safe options typically include lavender, chamomile, and ylang-ylang when properly diluted. Always consult your healthcare provider before using essential oils during pregnancy. Our app includes safety notes for each oil regarding pregnancy and nursing."
                },
                "q6": {
                    "question": "How should I store my essential oils?",
                    "answer": "Store essential oils in dark glass bottles (amber or cobalt blue) away from direct sunlight and heat. Keep them in a cool, dry place with tightly closed caps. Most oils last 2-5 years when stored properly, though citrus oils have a shorter shelf life of 1-2 years. Our app includes a tracking feature to monitor your oil inventory."
                },
                "q7": {
                    "question": "What is a carrier oil and why do I need one?",
                    "answer": "Carrier oils are neutral plant oils (like coconut, jojoba, or almond oil) used to dilute essential oils before topical application. They \"carry\" the essential oil onto your skin safely, preventing irritation or sensitivity reactions. A typical dilution is 2-3 drops of essential oil per teaspoon of carrier oil for adults."
                },
                "q8": {
                    "question": "Can children use essential oils safely?",
                    "answer": "Yes, but with extra caution. Children's skin is more sensitive, so always use higher dilution ratios (1 drop per tablespoon of carrier oil for ages 2+). Some oils like eucalyptus and peppermint should be avoided for young children. Our app provides age-specific safety guidelines for each essential oil."
                },
                "q9": {
                    "question": "How many drops of essential oil should I use?",
                    "answer": "It depends on the use: For diffusing, use 3-5 drops per 100ml of water. For topical application, use a 1-3% dilution (3-6 drops per teaspoon of carrier oil for adults). For baths, use 5-10 drops mixed with a dispersant like Epsom salts. Our app provides specific recommendations for each application method."
                },
                "q10": {
                    "question": "What are the best essential oils for beginners?",
                    "answer": "Great starter oils include: Lavender (relaxation, sleep), Peppermint (energy, headaches), Lemon (mood, cleaning), Tea Tree (skin support, immunity), and Frankincense (overall wellness). These versatile oils have multiple uses and are generally safe when properly diluted. Our app features beginner-friendly guides and recipes."
                },
                "q11": {
                    "question": "How long do essential oils last?",
                    "answer": "Shelf life varies by oil type. Most essential oils last 2-5 years when stored properly. Citrus oils (lemon, orange, grapefruit) have shorter shelf lives of 1-2 years. Woody oils (sandalwood, cedarwood) and some florals can last 6-8 years or more. Our inventory tracking feature helps you monitor freshness dates."
                },
                "q12": {
                    "question": "Can I mix different essential oils together?",
                    "answer": "Absolutely! Blending oils can create synergistic effects and custom aromas. Our app includes 100+ expert-crafted diffuser blends and allows you to create and save your own combinations. Start with simple 2-3 oil blends and follow our blending guidelines for balanced, effective results."
                },
                "q13": {
                    "question": "What's the difference between diffusing and topical application?",
                    "answer": "Diffusing releases oil molecules into the air for inhalation, affecting mood and respiratory system. It's great for ambiance and air purification. Topical application involves applying diluted oils to skin for targeted benefits. Both methods have unique advantages, and our app provides detailed guidance for each approach."
                },
                "q14": {
                    "question": "Are your recommendations based on scientific research?",

                    "question": "Was sind ätherische Öle und wie funktionieren sie?",
                    "answer": "Ätherische Öle sind konzentrierte Pflanzenextrakte, die den natürlichen Duft und die vorteilhaften Eigenschaften von Pflanzen einfangen. Sie wirken durch Aromatherapie (Einatmen) oder topische Anwendung und interagieren mit den Systemen Ihres Körpers, um Wohlbefinden zu fördern. Jedes Öl enthält einzigartige Verbindungen, die die physische und emotionale Gesundheit unterstützen können."

                "q2": {
                    "question": "Sind ätherische Öle sicher für die innere Anwendung?",
                    "answer": "Die innere Anwendung von ätherischen Ölen sollte nur unter Anleitung eines qualifizierten Gesundheitsfachmanns oder zertifizierten Aromatherapeuten erfolgen. Während einige Öle allgemein als sicher für die innere Anwendung in kleinen Mengen anerkannt sind, können andere toxisch sein. Unsere App bietet Sicherheitsinformationen für jedes Öl, aber konsultieren Sie immer einen Fachmann vor der inneren Anwendung."

                "q3": {
                    "question": "Wie wähle ich das richtige ätherische Öl für meine Bedürfnisse?",
                    "answer": "Unsere App macht es einfach! Suchen Sie in 400+ Gesundheitszuständen, um empfohlene Öle zu finden, oder durchsuchen Sie unsere Datenbank von 140+ ätherischen Ölen nach ihren Vorteilen. Jedes Ölprofil enthält therapeutische Eigenschaften, Sicherheitsüberlegungen und empfohlene Anwendungen. Beginnen Sie mit beliebten Ölen wie Lavendel zur Entspannung oder Pfefferminze für Energie."
                },
                "q4": {
                    "question": "Was ist der Unterschied zwischen reinen und synthetischen Ölen?",
                    "answer": "Reine ätherische Öle sind 100% natürliche Pflanzenextrakte ohne Zusätze oder synthetische Verbindungen. Synthetische Öle sind im Labor erstellte Düfte, die ähnlich riechen können, aber keine therapeutischen Vorteile haben. Reine Öle werden auf Reinheit und Wirksamkeit getestet, um sicherzustellen, dass Sie die vollen Wellness-Vorteile erhalten. Unsere App hilft Ihnen, Qualitätsindikatoren für jedes Öl zu identifizieren."
                },
                "q5": {
                    "question": "Kann ich ätherische Öle während der Schwangerschaft verwenden?",
                    "answer": "Einige ätherische Öle sollten während der Schwangerschaft vermieden werden, besonders im ersten Trimester. Sichere Optionen umfassen typischerweise Lavendel, Kamille und Ylang-Ylang bei richtiger Verdünnung. Konsultieren Sie immer Ihren Arzt, bevor Sie ätherische Öle während der Schwangerschaft verwenden. Unsere App enthält Sicherheitshinweise für jedes Öl bezüglich Schwangerschaft und Stillzeit."
                },
                "q6": {
                    "question": "Wie sollte ich meine ätherischen Öle lagern?",
                    "answer": "Lagern Sie ätherische Öle in dunklen Glasflaschen (bernsteinfarben oder kobaltblau) fern von direktem Sonnenlicht und Hitze. Bewahren Sie sie an einem kühlen, trockenen Ort mit fest verschlossenen Kappen auf. Die meisten Öle halten 2-5 Jahre bei richtiger Lagerung, obwohl Zitrusöle eine kürzere Haltbarkeit von 1-2 Jahren haben. Unsere App enthält eine Nachverfolgungsfunktion zur Überwachung Ihres Ölinventars."
                },
                "q7": {
                    "question": "Was ist ein Trägeröl und warum brauche ich eines?",
                    "answer": "Trägeröle sind neutrale Pflanzenöle (wie Kokos, Jojoba oder Mandelöl), die verwendet werden, um ätherische Öle vor der topischen Anwendung zu verdünnen. Sie 'tragen' das ätherische Öl sicher auf Ihre Haut und verhindern Reizungen oder Empfindlichkeitsreaktionen. Eine typische Verdünnung ist 2-3 Tropfen ätherisches Öl pro Teelöffel Trägeröl für Erwachsene."
                },
                "q8": {
                    "question": "Können Kinder ätherische Öle sicher verwenden?",
                    "answer": "Ja, aber mit extra Vorsicht. Kinderhaut ist empfindlicher, also verwenden Sie immer höhere Verdünnungsverhältnisse (1 Tropfen pro Esslöffel Trägeröl für Kinder ab 2 Jahren). Einige Öle wie Eukalyptus und Pfefferminze sollten für junge Kinder vermieden werden. Unsere App bietet altersspezifische Sicherheitsrichtlinien für jedes ätherische Öl."
                },
                "q9": {
                    "question": "Wie viele Tropfen ätherisches Öl sollte ich verwenden?",
                    "answer": "Es hängt von der Verwendung ab: Zum Verdunsten verwenden Sie 3-5 Tropfen pro 100ml Wasser. Für topische Anwendung verwenden Sie eine 1-3%ige Verdünnung (3-6 Tropfen pro Teelöffel Trägeröl für Erwachsene). Für Bäder verwenden Sie 5-10 Tropfen gemischt mit einem Dispergiermittel wie Bittersalz. Unsere App bietet spezifische Empfehlungen für jede Anwendungsmethode."
                },
                "q10": {
                    "question": "Was sind die besten ätherischen Öle für Anfänger?",
                    "answer": "Große Einsteigeröle sind: Lavendel (Entspannung, Schlaf), Pfefferminze (Energie, Kopfschmerzen), Zitrone (Stimmung, Reinigung), Teebaum (Hautunterstützung, Immunität) und Weihrauch (allgemeines Wohlbefinden). Diese vielseitigen Öle haben mehrere Verwendungsmöglichkeiten und sind bei richtiger Verdünnung allgemein sicher. Unsere App bietet anfängerfreundliche Anleitungen und Rezepte."

                "q11": {
                    "question": "Wie lange halten ätherische Öle?",
                    "answer": "Die Haltbarkeit variiert je nach Öltyp. Die meisten ätherischen Öle halten 2-5 Jahre bei richtiger Lagerung. Zitrusöle (Zitrone, Orange, Grapefruit) haben kürzere Haltbarkeiten von 1-2 Jahren. Hölzige Öle (Sandelholz, Zeder) und einige Blütenöle können 6-8 Jahre oder länger halten. Unsere Inventar-Nachverfolgungsfunktion hilft Ihnen, Frischheitsdaten zu überwachen."

                "q12": {
                    "question": "Kann ich verschiedene ätherische Öle mischen?",
                    "answer": "Absolut! Das Mischen von Ölen kann synergetische Effekte und individuelle Aromen erzeugen. Unsere App enthält 100+ von Experten erstellte Diffuser-Mischungen und ermöglicht es Ihnen, eigene Kombinationen zu erstellen und zu speichern. Beginnen Sie mit einfachen 2-3-Öl-Mischungen und folgen Sie unseren Mischrichtlinien für ausgewogene, effektive Ergebnisse."

                "q13": {
                    "question": "Was ist der Unterschied zwischen Verdunsten und topischer Anwendung?",
                    "answer": "Verdunsten setzt Ölmoleküle in die Luft zum Einatmen frei und beeinflusst Stimmung und Atemsystem. Es ist großartig für Atmosphäre und Luftreinigung. Topische Anwendung beinhaltet das Auftragen verdünnter Öle auf die Haut für gezielte Vorteile. Beide Methoden haben einzigartige Vorteile, und unsere App bietet detaillierte Anleitungen für jeden Ansatz."

                    "question": "Que sont les hoses essentielles et comment fonctionnent-elles ?",
                    "answer": "Les hoses essentielles sont des extraits de plantes concentrés qui capturent le parfum naturel et les propriétés bénéfiques des plantes. Elles fonctionnent par l'aromathérapie (inhalation) ou l'application topique, interagissant avec les systèmes de votre corps pour promouvoir le bien-être. Chaque huile contient des composés uniques qui peuvent soutenir la santé physique et émotionnelle."

                "q2": {
                    "question": "Les hoses essentielles sont-elles sûres à utiliser en interne ?",
                    "answer": "L'utilisation interne des hoses essentielles ne doit se faire que sous la direction d'un professionnel de santé qualifié ou d'un aromathérapeute certifié. Bien que certaines hoses soient généralement reconnues comme sûres pour un usage interne en petites quantités, d'autres peuvent être toxiques. Notre application fournit des informations de sécurité pour chaque huile, mais consultez toujours un professionnel avant un usage interne."

                    "question": "Comment choisir la bonne hose essentielle pour mes besoins ?",
                    "answer": "Notre application facilite la tâche ! Recherchez parmi plus de 400 conditions de santé pour trouver les hoses recommandées, ou parcourez notre base de données de plus de 140 hoses essentielles par leurs bienfaits. Chaque profil d'huile comprend les propriétés thérapeutiques, les considérations de sécurité et les utilisations recommandées. Commencez avec des hoses populaires comme la lavande pour la relaxation ou la menthe poivrée pour l'énergie."

                "q4": {
                    "question": "Quelle est la différence entre les hoses pures et synthétiques ?",
                    "answer": "Les hoses essentielles pures sont des extraits de plantes 100% naturels sans additifs ni composés synthétiques. Les hoses synthétiques sont des parfums créés en laboratoire qui peuvent sentir similaire mais manquent de thérapeut. Les hoses pures sont testées pour leur pureté et leur puissance, vous assurant d'obtenir tous les bienfaits pour le bien-être. Notre application vous aide à identifier les indicateurs de qualité pour chaque huile."
                },
                "q5": {
                    "question": "Puis-je utiliser des hoses essentielles pendant la grossesse ?",
                    "answer": "Certaines hoses essentielles doivent être évitées pendant la grossesse, surtout au premier trimestre. Les options sûres incluent typiquement la lavande, la camomille et l'ylang-ylang lorsqu'elles sont correctement diluées. Consultez toujours votre professionnel de santé avant d'utiliser des hoses essentielles pendant la grossesse. Notre application inclut des notes de sécurité pour chaque huile concernant la grossesse et l'allaitement."

                "q6": {
                    "question": "Comment dois-je conserver mes hoses essentielles ?",
                    "answer": "Conservez les hoses essentielles dans des flacons en verre foncé (ambre ou bleu cobalt) à l'abri de la lumière directe du soleil et de la chaleur. Gardez-les dans un endroit frais et sec avec des bouchons bien fermés. La plupart des hoses se conservent 2-5 ans lorsqu'elles sont stockées correctement, bien que les hoses d'agrumes aient une durée de vie plus courte de 1-2 ans. Notre application inclut une fonction de suivi pour surveiller votre inventaire d'huiles."
                },
                "q7": {
                    "question": "Qu'est-ce qu'une hose de support et pourquoi en ai-je besoin ?",
                    "answer": "Les hoses de support sont des hoses végétales neutres (comme le coco, le jojoba ou l'huile d'amande) utilisées pour diluer les hoses essentielles avant l'application topique. Elles 'transportent' l'huilée essentielle sur votre peau en toute sécurité, prévenant les irritations ou réactions de sensibilité. Une dilution typique est de 2-3 gouttes d'huilée essentielle par cuillère à café d'huilée de support pour les adultes."

                    "question": "Les enfants peuvent-ils utiliser les hoses essentielles en toute sécurité ?",
                    "answer": "Oui, mais avec une prudence supplémentaire. La peau des enfants est plus sensible, donc utilisez toujours des ratios de dilution plus élevés (1 goutte par cuillère à soupe d'huilée de support pour les 2 ans et plus). Certaines hoses comme l'eucalyptus et la menthe poivrée doivent être évitées pour les jeunes enfants. Notre application fournit des directives de sécurité spécifiques à l'âge pour chaque hose essentielle."
                },
                "q9": {
                    "question": "Combien de gouttes d'huilée essentielle dois-je utiliser ?",
                    "answer": "Cela dépend de l'utilisation : Pour la diffusion, utilisez 3-5 gouttes pour 100 ml d'eau. Pour l'application topique, utilisez une dilution de 1-3% (3-6 gouttes par cuillère à café d'huilée de support pour les adultes). Pour les bains, utilisez 5-10 gouttes mélangées avec un dispersant comme les sels d'Epsom. Notre application fournit des recommandations spécifiques pour chaque méthode d'application."

                "q10": {
                    "question": "Quelles sont les meilleures hoses essentielles pour les débutants ?",
                    "answer": "Les excellentes hoses pour débutants incluent : Lavande (relaxation, sommeil), Menthe poivrée (énergie, maux de tête), Citron (humeur, nettoyage), Arbre à thé (soutien cutané, immunité) et Encens (bien-être général). Ces hoses polyvalentes ont de multiples utilisations et sont généralement sûres lorsqu'elles sont correctement diluées. Notre application propose des guides et des recettes adaptés aux débutants."
                },
                "q11": {
                    "question": "Combien de temps durent les hoses essentielles ?",
                    "answer": "La durée de conservation varie selon le type d'huilée. La plupart des hoses essentielles se conservent 2-5 ans lorsqu'elles sont stockées correctement. Les hoses d'agrumes (citron, orange, pamplemousse) ont des durées de conservation plus courtes de 1-2 ans. Les hoses boisées (santal, cèdre) et certaines florales peuvent durer 6-8 ans ou plus. Notre fonction de suivi d'inventaire vous aide à surveiller les dates de fraîcheur."

                    "question": "Puis-je mélanger différentes hoses essentielles ensemble ?",
                    "answer": "Absolument ! Le mélange d'huiles peut créer des effets synergiques et des aromes personnalisés. Notre application comprend plus de 100 mélanges pour diffuseur créés par des experts et vous permet de créer et sauvegarder vos propres combinaisons. Commencez avec des mélanges simples de 2-3 hoses et suivez nos directives de mélange pour des résultats équilibrés et efficaces."

                "q13": {
                    "question": "Quelle est la différence entre la diffusion et l'application topique ?",
                    "answer": "La diffusion libère des molécules d'huilée dans l'air pour l'inhalation, affectant l'humeur et le système respiratoire. C'est génial pour l'ambiance et la purification de l'air. L'application topique implique l'application d'huiles diluées sur la peau pour des bienfaits ciblés. Les deux méthodes ont des avantages uniques, et notre application fournit des conseils détaillés pour chaque approche."

                    "question": "Cosa sono gli oli essenziali e come funzionano?",
                    "answer": "Gli oli essenziali sono estratti di piante concentrati che catturano il profumo naturale e le proprietà benefiche delle piante. Funzionano attraverso l'aromaterapia (inalazione) o l'applicazione topica, interagendo con i sistemi del tuo corpo per promuovere il benessere. Ogni olio contiene composti unici che possono supportare la salute fisica ed emotiva."

                "q2": {
                    "question": "Gli oli essenziali sono sicuri da usare internamente?",
                    "answer": "L'uso interno degli oli essenziali dovrebbe essere fatto solo sotto la guida di un professionista sanitario qualificato o un aromaterapeuta certificato. Mentre alcuni oli sono generalmente riconosciuti come sicuri per l'uso interno in piccole quantità, altri possono essere tossici. La nostra app fornisce informazioni sulla sicurezza per ogni olio, ma consulta sempre un professionista prima dell'uso interno."

                "q3": {
                    "question": "Come scelgo l'olio essenziale giusto per le mie esigenze?",
                    "answer": "La nostra app rende tutto facile! Cerca tra oltre 400 condizioni di salute per trovare gli oli raccomandati, o sfoglia il nostro database di oltre 140 oli essenziali per i loro benefici. Ogni profilo di olio include proprietà terapeutiche, considerazioni sulla sicurezza e usi raccomandati. Inizia con oli popolari come lavanda per il rilassamento o menta piperita per l'energia."

                "q4": {
                    "question": "Qual è la differenza tra oli puri e sintetici?",
                    "answer": "Gli oli essenziali puri sono estratti di piante al 100% naturali senza additivi o composti sintetici. Gli oli sintetici sono fragranze create in laboratorio che possono avere un odore simile ma mancano di benefici terapeutici. Gli oli puri sono testati per purezza e potenza, assicurandoti di ottenere tutti i benefici per il benessere. La nostra app ti aiuta a identificare gli indicatori di qualità per ogni olio."

                "q5": {
                    "question": "Posso usare gli oli essenziali durante la gravidanza?",
                    "answer": "Alcuni oli essenziali dovrebbero essere evitati durante la gravidanza, specialmente nel primo trimestre. Le opzioni sicure tipicamente includono lavanda, camomilla e ylang-ylang quando correttamente diluiti. Consulta sempre il tuo operatore sanitario prima di usare oli essenziali durante la gravidanza. La nostra app include note sulla sicurezza per ogni olio riguardo gravidanza e allattamento."
                },
                "q6": {
                    "question": "Come dovrei conservare i miei oli essenziali?",
                    "answer": "Conserva gli oli essenziali in bottiglie di vetro scuro (ambra o blu cobalto) lontano dalla luce solare diretta e dal calore. Tienili in un luogo fresco e asciutto con tappi ben chiusi. La maggior parte degli oli dura 2-5 anni quando conservati correttamente, anche se gli oli agrumati hanno una durata più breve di 1-2 anni. La nostra app include una funzione di tracciamento per monitorare il tuo inventario di oli."
                },
                "q7": {
                    "question": "Cos'è un olio vettore e perché ne ho bisogno?",
                    "answer": "Gli oli vettore sono oli vegetali neutri (come cocco, jojoba o olio di mandorla) usati per diluire gli oli essenziali prima dell'applicazione topica. 'Trasportano' l'olio essenziale sulla tua pelle in sicurezza, prevenendo irritazioni o reazioni di sensibilità. Una diluizione tipica è 2-3 gocce di olio essenziale per cucchiaino di olio vettore per adulti."

                "q8": {
                    "question": "I bambini possono usare gli oli essenziali in sicurezza?",
                    "answer": "Sì, ma con cautela extra. La pelle dei bambini è più sensibile, quindi usa sempre rapporti di diluizione più alti (1 goccia per cucchiaio di olio vettore per età 2+). Alcuni oli come eucalipto e menta piperita dovrebbero essere evitati per i bambini piccoli. La nostra app fornisce linee guida sulla sicurezza specifiche per età per ogni olio essenziale."
                },
                "q9": {
                    "question": "Quante gocce di olio essenziale dovrei usare?",
                    "answer": "Dipende dall'uso: Per la diffusione, usa 3-5 gocce per 100ml di acqua. Per l'applicazione topica, usa una diluizione 1-3% (3-6 gocce per cucchiaino di olio vettore per adulti). Per i bagni, usa 5-10 gocce mescolate con un disperdente come sali di Epsom. La nostra app fornisce raccomandazioni specifiche per ogni metodo di applicazione."

                "q10": {
                    "question": "Quali sono i migliori oli essenziali per i principianti?",
                    "answer": "Ottimi oli per iniziare includono: Lavanda (rilassamento, sonno), Menta piperita (energia, mal di testa), Limone (umore, pulizia), Tea tree (supporto pelle, immunità) e Incenso (benessere generale). Questi oli versatili hanno molteplici usi e sono generalmente sicuri quando correttamente diluiti. La nostra app presenta guide e ricette adatte ai principianti."
                },
                "q11": {
                    "question": "Quanto durano gli oli essenziali?",
                    "answer": "La durata varia per tipo di olio. La maggior parte degli oli essenziali dura 2-5 anni quando conservati correttamente. Gli oli agrumati (limone, arancia, pompelmo) hanno durate più brevi di 1-2 anni. Gli oli legnosi (sandalo, cedro) e alcuni floreali possono durare 6-8 anni o più. La nostra funzione di tracciamento inventario ti aiuta a monitorare le date di freschezza."

                    "question": "Posso mescolare diversi oli essenziali insieme?",
                    "answer": "Assolutamente! Mescolare oli può creare effetti sinergici e aromi personalizzati. La nostra app include oltre 100 miscele per diffusore create da esperti e ti permette di creare e salvare le tue combinazioni. Inizia con semplici miscele di 2-3 oli e segui le nostre linee guida per risultati equilibrati ed efficaci."

                "q13": {
                    "question": "Qual è la differenza tra diffusione e applicazione topica?",
                    "answer": "La diffusione rilascia molecole di olio nell'aria per inalazione, influenzando umore e sistema respiratorio. È ottima per atmosfera e purificazione dell'aria. L'applicazione topica comporta l'applicazione di oli diluiti sulla pelle per benefici mirati. Entrambi i metodi hanno vantaggi unici, e la nostra app fornisce indicazioni dettagliate per ogni approccio."

                    "question": "Le vostre raccomandazioni si basano su ricerca scientifica?",
                    "answer": "Il nostro database include informazioni da ricerca peer-reviewed, uso tradizionale e pratiche di aromaterapia certificate. Mentre gli oli essenziali offrono supporto al benessere, i nostri contenuti sono solo a scopo informativo e non intesi a diagnosticare, trattare o curare alcuna condizione.

Cada aceite contiene compuestos únicos que pueden apoyar la salud física y emocional."

                "q2": {
                    "question": "¿Es seguro usar aceites esenciales internamente?",
                    "answer": "El uso interno de aceites esenciales solo debe hacerse bajo la guía de un profesional de salud calificado o aromaterapeuta certificado. Aunque algunos aceites son generalmente reconocidos como seguros para uso interno en pequeñas cantidades, otros pueden ser tóxicos. Nuestra aplicación proporciona información de seguridad para cada aceite, pero siempre consulta a un profesional antes del uso interno."

                    "question": "¿Cuál es la diferencia entre aceites puros y sintéticos?",
                    "answer": "Los aceites esenciales puros son extractos de plantas 100% naturales sin aditivos ni compuestos sintéticos. Los aceites sintéticos son fragancias creadas en laboratorio que pueden oler similar pero carecen de beneficios terapéuticos.

                    "answer": "Algunos aceites esenciales deben evitarse durante el embarazo, especialmente en el primer trimestre. Las opciones seguras típicamente incluyen lavanda, manzanilla e ylang-ylang cuando se diluyen correctamente.

                    "question": "¿Cómo debo almacenar mis aceites esenciales?",
                    "answer": "Almacena los aceites esenciales en botellas de vidrio oscuro (ámbar o azul cobalto) lejos de la luz solar directa y calor. Mantenlos en un lugar fresco y seco con tapas bien cerradas. La mayoría de los aceites duran 2-5 años cuando se almacenan correctamente, aunque los aceites cítricos tienen una vida útil más corta de 1-2 años. Nuestra aplicación incluye una función de seguimiento para monitorear tu inventario de aceites."

                    "question": "¿Qué es un aceite portador y por qué necesito uno?",
                    "answer": "Los aceites portadores son aceites vegetales neutros (como coco, jojoba o aceite de almendra) usados para diluir aceites esenciales antes de la aplicación tópica. 'Transportan' el aceite esencial sobre tu piel de forma segura, previniendo irritación o reacciones de sensibilidad. Una dilución típica es 2-3 gotas de aceite esencial por cucharadita de aceite portador para adultos."

                    "question": "¿Pueden los niños usar aceites esenciales de forma segura?",
                    "answer": "Sí, pero con precaución extra. La piel de los niños es más sensible, así que siempre usa proporciones de dilución más altas (1 gota por cucharada de aceite portador para mayores de 2 años). Algunos aceites como eucalipto y menta deben evitarse para niños pequeños. Nuestra aplicación proporciona directrices de seguridad específicas por edad para cada aceite esencial."

                    "question": "¿Cuántas gotas de aceite esencial debo usar?",
                    "answer": "Depende del uso: Para difusión, usa 3-5 gotas por 100ml de agua. Para aplicación tópica, usa una dilución del 1-3% (3-6 gotas por cucharadita de aceite portador para adultos). Para baños, usa 5-10 gotas mezcladas con un dispersante como sales de Epsom. Nuestra aplicación proporciona recomendaciones específicas para cada método de aplicación."

                    "question": "¿Cuánto duran los aceites esenciales?",
                    "answer": "La vida útil varía por tipo de aceite. La mayoría de los aceites esenciales duran 2-5 años cuando se almacenan correctamente. Los aceites cítricos (limón, naranja, toronja) tienen vidas útiles más cortas de 1-2 años. Los aceites maderosos (sándalo, cedro) y algunos florales pueden durar 6-8 años o más.

                    "answer": "La difusión libera moléculas de aceite en el aire para inhalación, afectando el estado de ánimo y el sistema respiratorio. Es excelente para atmósfera y purificación del aire. La aplicación tópico implica aplicar aceites diluidos en la piel para beneficios específicos. Ambos métodos tienen ventajas únicas, y nuestra aplicación proporciona orientación detallada para cada enfoque."

Pielea copiilor este mai sensibilă, așa că folosește întotdeauna rapoarte de diluare mai mari (1 picătură per lingură de ulei purtător pentru vârste de 2+ ani). Unele uleiuri ca eucaliptul și menta trebuie evitate pentru copiii mici. Aplicația noastră oferă ghiduri de siguranță specifice pe vârstă pentru fiecare ulei esențial."

Pentru aplicare topic, folosește o diluare de 1-3% (3-6 picături per linguriță de ulei purtător pentru adulți). Pentru băi, folosește 5-10 picături amestecate cu un dispersant ca săruri Epsom.
