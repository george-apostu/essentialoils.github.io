            {
                "question": "What are essential oils and how do they work?",
                "answer": "Essential oils are concentrated plant extracts that capture the natural scent and beneficial properties of plants. They work through aromatherapy (inhalation) or topical application, interacting with your body's systems to promote wellness. Each oil contains unique compounds that can support physical and emotional health."
            },
            {
                "question": "Are essential oils safe to use internally?",
                "answer": "Internal use of essential oils should only be done under the guidance of a qualified healthcare professional or certified aromatherapist. While some oils are generally recognized as safe for internal use in small amounts, others can be toxic. Our app provides safety information for each oil, but always consult a professional before internal use."
            },
            {
                "question": "How do I choose the right essential oil for my needs?",
                "answer": "Our app makes it easy! Search from 400+ health conditions to find recommended oils, or browse our database of 140+ essential oils by their benefits. Each oil profile includes therapeutic properties, safety considerations, and recommended uses. Start with popular oils like lavender for relaxation or peppermint for energy."
            },
            {
                "question": "What is the difference between pure and synthetic oils?",
                "answer": "Pure essential oils are 100% natural plant extracts without additives or synthetic compounds. Synthetic oils are laboratory-created fragrances that may smell similar but lack therapeutic benefits. Pure oils are tested for purity and potency, ensuring you get the full wellness benefits. Our app helps you identify quality indicators for each oil."
            },
            {
                "question": "Can I use essential oils during pregnancy?",
                "answer": "Some essential oils should be avoided during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester. Safe options typically include lavender, chamomile, and ylang-ylang when properly diluted. Always consult your healthcare provider before using essential oils during pregnancy. Our app includes safety notes for each oil regarding pregnancy and nursing."
            },
            {
                "question": "How should I store my essential oils?",
                "answer": "Store essential oils in dark glass bottles (amber or cobalt blue) away from direct sunlight and heat. Keep them in a cool, dry place with tightly closed caps. Most oils last 2-5 years when stored properly, though citrus oils have a shorter shelf life of 1-2 years. Our app includes a tracking feature to monitor your oil inventory."
            },
            {
                "question": "What is a carrier oil and why do I need one?",
                "answer": "Carrier oils are neutral plant oils (like coconut, jojoba, or almond oil) used to dilute essential oils before topical application. They \"carry\" the essential oil onto your skin safely, preventing irritation or sensitivity reactions. A typical dilution is 2-3 drops of essential oil per teaspoon of carrier oil for adults."
            },
            {
                "question": "Can children use essential oils safely?",
                "answer": "Yes, but with extra caution. Children's skin is more sensitive, so always use higher dilution ratios (1 drop per tablespoon of carrier oil for ages 2+). Some oils like eucalyptus and peppermint should be avoided for young children. Our app provides age-specific safety guidelines for each essential oil."
            },
            {
                "question": "How many drops of essential oil should I use?",
                "answer": "It depends on the use: For diffusing, use 3-5 drops per 100ml of water. For topical application, use a 1-3% dilution (3-6 drops per teaspoon of carrier oil for adults). For baths, use 5-10 drops mixed with a dispersant like Epsom salts. Our app provides specific recommendations for each application method."
            },
            {
                "question": "What are the best essential oils for beginners?",
                "answer": "Great starter oils include: Lavender (relaxation, sleep), Peppermint (energy, headaches), Lemon (mood, cleaning), Tea Tree (skin support, immunity), and Frankincense (overall wellness). These versatile oils have multiple uses and are generally safe when properly diluted. Our app features beginner-friendly guides and recipes."
            },
            {
                "question": "How long do essential oils last?",
                "answer": "Shelf life varies by oil type. Most essential oils last 2-5 years when stored properly. Citrus oils (lemon, orange, grapefruit) have shorter shelf lives of 1-2 years. Woody oils (sandalwood, cedarwood) and some florals can last 6-8 years or more. Our inventory tracking feature helps you monitor freshness dates."
            },
            {
                "question": "Can I mix different essential oils together?",
                "answer": "Absolutely! Blending oils can create synergistic effects and custom aromas. Our app includes 100+ expert-crafted diffuser blends and allows you to create and save your own combinations. Start with simple 2-3 oil blends and follow our blending guidelines for balanced, effective results."
            },
            {
                "question": "What's the difference between diffusing and topical application?",
                "answer": "Diffusing releases oil molecules into the air for inhalation, affecting mood and respiratory system. It's great for ambiance and air purification. Topical application involves applying diluted oils to skin for targeted benefits. Both methods have unique advantages, and our app provides detailed guidance for each approach."
            },
            {
                "question": "Are your recommendations based on scientific research?",
                "answer": "Our database includes information from peer-reviewed research, traditional use, and certified aromatherapy practices. While essential oils offer wellness support, our content is for informational purposes only and not intended to diagnose, treat, or cure any condition. Always consult healthcare professionals for medical concerns."
            },
